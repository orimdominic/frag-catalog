## Fragrances Catalog

A simple android app for the offline database management of a 
mini fragrance store.

The app allows the user to perform basic CRUD operations which include:

* Creating  fragrances with the properties name, ret_price, quantity in stock and gender
* Viewing a list of all the fragrances saved. The list shows the name, ret_price, gender,
quantity sold and quantity remaining in stock
* Updating fragrance properties such as name, ret_price, quantity sold, quantity remaining in stock and gender
* Delete fragrances (single and multipl at a time)

The app also allows the user to

* Search for fragrances by name, track the quantity sold for each fragrance and also 
* Share the fragrances and the properties of the fragrance on WhatsApp and other platforms. 

The app uses Android Room SQLite database to store data locally. It does not store data online
