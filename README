This is an Android app created for the offline database management
of a fragrance shop.

The app also allows the user to search for fragrances by name, track
the quantity sold for each fragrance and also share the fragrances
and the properties of the frgrance through text-based implicit intents
for cases where the user might want to share the content of the inventory
with a prospective customer.
